## Why is this repository here?
This repository accompanies the hands-on portion of the HSHSL workshop **Scholarly Publishing with GitHub for Teams &amp; Individuals**. It is the basis for students to:
  1. fork this repository to their own GitHub account,
  2. edit files on a new branch of their forked version of this repository,
  3. commit the edits to their repository,
  4. then submit a pull request to merge the updated files to the source of the forked repository.

The above four steps represent a common GitHub (and git) workflow for both teams and individuals.
